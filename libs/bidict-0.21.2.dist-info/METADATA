``bidict``:
^^^^^^^^^^^

- has been used for many years by several teams at
  **Google, Venmo, CERN, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bloomberg, Two Sigma,** and many others
- has carefully designed APIs for
  **safety, simplicity, flexibility, and ergonomics**
- is **fast, lightweight, and has no runtime dependencies** other than Python's standard library
- **integrates natively** with Python’s ``collections.abc`` interfaces
- provides **type hints** for all public APIs
- is implemented in **concise, well-factored, pure (PyPy-compatible) Python code**
  that is **optimized for running efficiently**
  as well as for **reading and learning** [#fn-learning]_
- has **extensive docs and test coverage**
  (including property-based tests and benchmarks)
  run continuously on all supported Python versions


Note: Python 3 Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As promised in the 0.18.2 release (see :doc:`changelog` [#fn-changelog]_),
**Python 2 is no longer supported**.
Version 0.18.3
is the last release of ``bidict`` that supports Python 2.
This makes ``bidict`` more efficient on Python 3
and enables further improvement to bidict in the future.
See `python3statement.org <https://python3statement.org>`__
for more info.


Installation
------------

``pip install bidict``


Quick Start
-----------

.. code:: python

   >>> from bidict import bidict
   >>> element_by_symbol = bidict({'H': 'hydrogen'})
   >>> element_by_symbol['H']
   'hydrogen'
   >>> element_by_symbol.inverse['hydrogen']
   'H'


For more usage documentation,
head to the :doc:`intro` [#fn-intro]_
and proceed from there.

to be notified when new versions of ``bidict`` are released.


Learning from ``bidict``
------------------------

One of the best things about ``bidict``
is that it touches a surprising number of
interesting Python corners,
especially given its small size and scope.

Check out :doc:`learning-from-bidict` [#fn-learning]_
if you're interested in learning more.


Contributing
------------

``bidict`` is currently a one-person operation
maintained on a voluntary basis.

Your help would be most welcome!


Reviewers Wanted!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the most valuable ways to contribute to ``bidict`` –
and to explore some interesting Python corners [#fn-learning]_
while you're at it –
is to review the relatively small codebase.

Please create an issue or pull request with any improvements you'd propose
or any other results you found.
Submitting a `draft PR <https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/>`__
with feedback in inline code comments, or a
`"Review results" issue <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/new?title=Review+results>`__,
would each work well.

You can also
+1 `this issue <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/63>`__
to sign up to give feedback on future proposed changes
that are in need of a reviewer.


Giving Back
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. duplicated in CONTRIBUTING.rst
   (would use `.. include::` but GitHub doesn't understand it)

``bidict`` is the product of hundreds of hours of unpaid, voluntary work.

If ``bidict`` has helped you accomplish your work,
especially work you've been paid for,
please consider chipping in toward the costs
of its maintenance and development
and/or ask your organization to do the same.
