GuessIt is a python library that extracts as much information as possible from a video filename.

It has a very powerful matcher that allows to guess properties from a video using its filename only.
This matcher works with both movies and tv shows episodes.

For example, GuessIt can do the following::

    $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
    For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
    GuessIt found: {
        "title": "Treme",
        "season": 1,
        "episode": 3,
        "episode_title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
        "source": "HDTV",
        "video_codec": "Xvid",
        "release_group": "NoTV",
        "container": "avi",
        "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
        "type": "episode"
    }

More information are available at `ReadTheDocs <http://guessit.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Migration note
--------------
GuessIt 2 has been rewriten from scratch. GuessIt is now a release name parser only, and support for additional
features like hashes computations has been dropped.

To migrate from guessit ``0.x`` or ``1.x`` to ``guessit 2.x``, please read
`migration.rst <https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit/blob/master/docs/migration.rst>`_.

To migrate from guessit ``2.x`` to ``3.x``, please read `migration2to3.rst <https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit/blob/master/docs/migration2to3.rst>`_.

Install
-------

Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install guessit

You can also `install GuessIt from sources <https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit/blob/master/docs/sources.rst>`_

                   [filename [filename ...]]

    positional arguments:
      filename              Filename or release name to guess

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    Naming:
      -t TYPE, --type TYPE  The suggested file type: movie, episode. If undefined,

      -l, --enforce-list    Wrap each found value in a list even when property has
                            a single value
      -j, --json            Display information for filename guesses as json

                            output

    Configuration:
      -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                            Filepath to configuration file. Configuration file
                            contains the same options as those from command line
                            options, but option names have "-" characters replaced
                            with "_". This configuration will be merged with
                            default and user configuration files.
      --no-user-config      Disable user configuration. If not defined, guessit
                            tries to read configuration files at
                            ~/.guessit/options.(json|yml|yaml) and
                            ~/.config/guessit/options.(json|yml|yaml)
      --no-default-config   Disable default configuration. This should be done
                            only if you are providing a full configuration through
                            user configuration or --config option. If no
                            "advanced_config" is provided by another configuration
                            file, it will still be loaded from default
                            configuration.

    Information:
      -p, --properties      Display properties that can be guessed.
      -V, --values          Display property values that can be guessed.
      --version             Display the guessit version.


It can also be used as a python module::

    >>> from guessit import guessit
    >>> guessit('Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi')
    MatchesDict([('title', 'Treme'), ('season', 1), ('episode', 3), ('episode_title', 'Right Place, Wrong Time'), ('source', 'HDTV'), ('video_codec', 'Xvid'), ('release_group', 'NoTV'), ('container', 'avi'), ('mimetype', 'video/x-msvideo'), ('type', 'episode')])

``MatchesDict`` is a dict that keeps matches ordering.

Command line options can be given as dict or string to the second argument.

Docker
------

GuessIt is also available on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/guessit/guessit/>`_ as a Docker Image.::

    $ docker run -it guessit/guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
    For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
    GuessIt found: {
        "title": "Treme",
        "season": 1,
        "episode": 3,
        "episode_title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",

        "type": "episode"
    }
