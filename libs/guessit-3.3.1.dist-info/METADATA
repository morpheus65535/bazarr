GuessIt is a python library that extracts as much information as
possible from a video filename.

It has a very powerful matcher that allows to guess properties from a
video using its filename only. This matcher works with both movies and
tv shows episodes.

For example, GuessIt can do the following:

    $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
    For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
    GuessIt found: {
        "title": "Treme",
        "season": 1,
        "episode": 3,
        "episode_title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
        "source": "HDTV",
        "video_codec": "Xvid",
        "release_group": "NoTV",
        "container": "avi",
        "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
        "type": "episode"
    }
