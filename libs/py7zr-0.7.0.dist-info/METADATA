Pure python 7-zip implementation


Dependency
==========

`py7zr` uses a python3 standard `lzma module`_ for extraction and compression.
The standard lzma module uses `liblzma`_ that support core compression algorithm of 7zip.

Minimum required version is Python 3.5.
Two additional library is required only on Python3.5; contextlib2 and pathlib2.

Compression is supported on Python 3.6 and later.

There are other runtime requrements; texttable, pycryptodome

Version recommendations are:

- CPython 3.7.5, CPython 3.8.0 and later.
- PyPy3.6-7.2.0 and later.

Following fixes are included in these versions, and it is not fixed on python3.6.

- `BPO-21872`_: LZMA library sometimes fails to decompress a file
- `PyPy3-3088`_: lzma.LZMADecomporessor.decompress does not respect max_length


.. _`lzma module`: https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html
.. _`liblzma`: https://tukaani.org/xz/
.. _`BPO-21872`: https://bugs.python.org/issue21872
.. _`PyPy3-3088`: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/3088/lzmalzmadecompressordecompress-data


Compression Methods
===================

'py7zr' supports algorithms and filters which python3 standard `lzma module`_ and `liblzma`_ support.
It also support algorithms that is implemented in python core such as Bzip2.
It does not support one which `lzma module`_ and `liblzma`_ can not handle such as BCJ2.

Here is a table of algorithms.

+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Category                        | Algorithms                             |
+=================================+========================================+
| Compress/Decompress Supported   | LZMA2                                  |
|                                 | BCJ(X86, IA64, ARM, ARMT, PPC, POWERPC)|
+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Decompress only                 | LZMA, Delta, COPY, Bzip2, Deflate      |
| (Decryption)                    | AES                                    |
+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Unsupported or not worked       | PPMd, BCJ2, LZMA+BCJ                   |
+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

- A feature handling symbolic link is basically compatible with 'p7zip' implementation,
  but not work with original 7-zip because the original does not implement the feature.


Document
========

Here is a readthedocs `manual`_ document.

.. _`manual`: https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Usage
=====

You can run command script py7zr like as follows;

.. code-block::

    $ py7zr l test.7z
    $ py7zr x test.7z
    $ py7zr x -P test.7z
      password?: ****
    $ py7zr w target.7z test_dir
    $ py7zr help


py7zr is a library which can use in your python application.
Here is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your applicaiton.

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r')
    archive.extractall(path="/tmp")
    archive.close()


Here is a code snippet how to produce archive.

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w')
    archive.writeall('./base_dir')
    archive.close()


You can also use 'with' block because py7zr provide context manager(v0.6 and later).

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r') as z:
        z.extractall()

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as z:
        z.writeall('./base_dir')


py7zr also supports extraction of single or selected files by 'extract(targets=['file path'])'.
Note: if you specify only a file but not a parent directory, it will fail.

.. code-block::

    import py7zr
    import re

    filter_pattern = re.compile(r'<your/target/file_and_directories/regex/expression>')
    with SevenZipFile('archive.7z', 'r') as archive:
        allfiles = archive.getnames()
        selective_files = [f if filter_pattern.match(f) for f in allfiles]
        archive.extract(targets=selective_files)


py7zr support an extraction of password protected archive.(v0.6 and later)

.. code-block::

    import py7zr

    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('encrypted.7z', mode='r', password='secret') as z:
        z.extractall()



py7zr also support `shutil`  interface.

.. code-block::

    from py7zr import pack_7zarchvie, unpack_7zarchive
    import shutil

    # register file format at first.
    shutil.register_archive_format('7zip', pack_7zarchive, description='7zip archive')
    shutil.register_unpack_format('7zip', ['.7z'], unpack_7zarchive)

    # extraction
    shutil.unpack_archive('test.7z', '/tmp')

    # compression
    shutil.make_archive('target', '7zip', 'src')

Use Cases
=========

- `aqtinstall`_ Another (unofficial) Qt (aqt) CLI Installer on multi-platforms.
- PreNLP_ Preprocessing Library for Natural Language Processing
- mlox_  a tool for sorting and analyzing Morrowind plugin load order

===========

Added
-----

* Support dereference option of SevenZipFile class. (#131)
