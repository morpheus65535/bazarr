Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very
acceptable performance.  It has no dependencies except ones which live in the
Python standard library.  It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python
2.7+ and Python 3.4+.  It is also known to run on PyPy 1.6.0+ on UNIX.  It
supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

1.4.3 (2020-02-02)
------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In Waitress version 1.4.2 a new regular expression was added to validate the
  headers that Waitress receives to make sure that it matches RFC7230.
  Unfortunately the regular expression was written in a way that with invalid
  input it leads to catastrophic backtracking which allows for a Denial of
  Service and CPU usage going to a 100%.

  This was reported by Fil Zembowicz to the Pylons Project. Please see
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-73m2-3pwg-5fgc
  for more information.

1.4.2 (2020-01-02)
------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This is a follow-up to the fix introduced in 1.4.1 to tighten up the way
  Waitress strips whitespace from header values. This makes sure Waitress won't
  accidentally treat non-printable characters as whitespace and lead to a
  potental HTTP request smuggling/splitting security issue.

  Thanks to ZeddYu Lu for the extra test cases.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16789

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Updated the regex used to validate header-field content to match the errata
  that was published for RFC7230.

  See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=7230&eid=4189


1.4.1 (2019-12-24)
------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Waitress did not properly validate that the HTTP headers it received were
  properly formed, thereby potentially allowing a front-end server to treat a
  request different from Waitress. This could lead to HTTP request
  smuggling/splitting.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16789

1.4.0 (2019-12-20)
------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

- Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without
  setting the ``Connection: close`` header as appropriate in the response. This
  is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when
  responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500
  Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the
  connection after the response is sent.

- Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name
  and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not
  vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent
  back a 400 Bad Request. See https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Waitress implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230
  (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) which states:

      Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is
      the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line
      terminator and ignore any preceding CR.

  Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF
  the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and
  the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This
  can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress
  may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP
  message.

  For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu
  https://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/

  Please see the security advisory for more information:

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16785

- Waitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``
  requests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security
  issue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be
  properly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.

- Waitress now validates that the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header contains only
  transfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the
  only valid header value being ``chunked``.

  That means that if the following header is sent:

  ``Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked``

  Waitress will send back a 501 Not Implemented with an error message stating
  as such, as while Waitress supports ``chunked`` encoding it does not support
  ``gzip`` and it is unable to pass that to the underlying WSGI environment
  correctly.

  Waitress DOES NOT implement support for ``Transfer-Encoding: identity``
  eventhough ``identity`` was valid in RFC2616, it was removed in RFC7230.
  Please update your clients to remove the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header if the
  only transfer coding is ``identity`` or update your client to use
  ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` instead of ``Transfer-Encoding: identity,
  chunked``.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-g2xc-35jw-c63p

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16786

- While validating the ``Transfer-Encoding`` header, Waitress now properly
  handles line-folded ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers or those that contain
  multiple comma seperated values. This closes a potential issue where a
  front-end server may treat the request as being a chunked request (and thus
  ignoring the Content-Length) and Waitress using the Content-Length as it was
  looking for the single value ``chunked`` and did not support comma seperated
  values.

- Waitress used to explicitly set the Content-Length header to 0 if it was
  unable to parse it as an integer (for example if the Content-Length header
  was sent twice (and thus folded together), or was invalid) thereby allowing
  for a potential request to be split and treated as two requests by HTTP
  pipelining support in Waitress. If Waitress is now unable to parse the
  Content-Length header, a 400 Bad Request is sent back to the client.
