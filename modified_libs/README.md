# bazarr modified or self-written libs

This directory holds external dependencies that are
either built by the bazarr project, moved from other
projects to bazarr, or taken from upstream and modified
without having contributed back the changes, or simply libraries
that are not available in the state bazarr wants/needs them.

This file tries to keep track of those.
Tracking is a manual process, so it is possible this file is not
complete or up-to-date.

The project started uploading releases to pypi starting
at version 1.1.13. The version tested with bazarr is 1.1.9
with some commits to upstream pulled in, and a locally fetched
browsers.json file.

It's basically:
1.1.9 - https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper/commit/7bc0ee6f72458a2385184ff49b9b3930ba7592d6
patch for loading browsers.json:
https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper/commit/84fcf9e049230b9b0106d74c4e8c96cbab7ca11e:

Installing 1.1.9 from git does not pull in the browsers.json.
Earliest packaged version is with 1.1.13, but this brings in a lot of
changes around reCaptcha handling that breaks the way it is used
by subliminal_patch now.

Version bundled is not easy to get the correct version for.
Also, original author moved their focus to their own subliminal fork.
